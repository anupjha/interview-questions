# Longest Path in a Matrix
Given an n by n matrix, find the longest path (moving up, down, left, or right)
of numbers, where each number in the path is one greater than the previous number.

## Example
```
[
  [6, 5, 3],
  [2, 3, 4],
  [5, 4, 7],
]
```

Should output `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. Other valid paths include `[5, 6]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, `[3, 4, 5]`,
but `[2, 3, 4, 5]` is the longest.

## Tips
* Discuss big-O complexity
