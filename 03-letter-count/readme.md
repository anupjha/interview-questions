# Letter Counts

Some English words contain the same letter more than once, e.g.
the word "therefore" contains the letter E three times.

Given a chunk of English text, find the word with the most occurrences of a single letter.

For exaple, with input "O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?" you should return "Wherefore",
since that contains three Es.

## Tips:
* Ask clarifying questions
  * What to do in the event of a tie?
  * Are capital and lower case letters the same?
