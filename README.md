# Interview Questions
This is a set of practice questions for technical interviews.

Each directory contains a question, along with an answer in JavaScript.

## Tests
Tests are run with mocha
```
npm install -g mocha
```

### Running all tests
```
mocha **/test.js
```

### Trying your own answers
You can replace `answer.js` with your own solution and run
```
mocha {question_name}/test.js
```
to check it against a few test cases.
