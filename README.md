# Interview Questions
This is a set of practice questions for technical interviews, created for
the [Boston Tech Interview Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Tech-Interview-Meetup/)

Each directory contains a question, along with an answer in JavaScript.

## Tests
Tests are run with mocha
```
npm install -g mocha
mocha code/**/test.js
```

### Trying your own answers
You can replace `answer.js` with your own solution and run
```
mocha code/{question_name}/test.js
```
to check it against a few test cases.
