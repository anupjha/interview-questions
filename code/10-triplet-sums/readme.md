# Triplet Sums
Given an array of integers and a target sum, output the number of
triplets in the array whose sum is <= the target sum.

## Example
Input:
  * Array: [3, -2, 1, 3],
  * Target: 5
Output:
  * 3 ([3, -2, 3], [3, -2, 1], and [-2, 1, 3] all sum to <= 5)

## Tips
* Try a naive soulution first
* Try and get complexity to O(n^2)
* How would you generalize your code to handle n-tuples for arbitrary n
