# Longest Common Substring

Given two input strings, find the longest substring common to both strings.

For example, given "ABRACADABRA" and "CADENCE", you should return "CAD".

## Tips
* Try a naive solution before worrying about time complexity
* Discuss the big-O complexity of your solution
* Bonus: try for an O(n + m) solution
